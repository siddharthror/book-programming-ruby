Notes

The .tgz file is a gzip-compressed tar archive, and can be extracted with a
command such as:

	$ tar xzf ruby-code.tgz

The .zip file is a standard Zip archive, and can be extracted with (for
example):

	C:\temp> unzip ruby-code.zip

Although not universally true, zip files are more commonly used on Windows
systems, while tar files are used on Unix-based systems. You may need to
download a separate utility to extract files from an archive on Windows.
